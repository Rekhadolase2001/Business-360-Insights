This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize key performance metrics across various departments at AtliQ Hardware. It provides actionable insights into finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive operations, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions for strategic growth.

## **Problem Statement**
AtliQ Technologies, a fast-growing consumer electronics company, had been using Excel-based analytics, which was inefficient and lacked scalability. The limitations became apparent when the company faced significant financial losses in Latin America, primarily due to:

❌ Delayed insights—manual reporting couldn’t provide real-time updates

❌ Lack of data integration—siloed information across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain

❌ Inaccurate forecasting—leading to poor budget allocation and supply chain inefficiencies

❌ Limited data visualization—making it difficult for stakeholders to extract meaningful insights

❌ The need for a robust, real-time business intelligence solution was clear.

## **Objective**
To develop a scalable, automated, and interactive Power BI solution that allows stakeholders across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain to access real-time, data-driven insights for better decision-making.

By implementing a structured data analytics approach, the solution aimed to:

✅ **Enhance data accessibility**—centralized reporting for better collaboration

✅ **Improve forecasting accuracy**—data-backed predictions for budgeting and inventory planning

✅ **Reduce manual effort**—automated data refresh and reporting

✅ **Provide intuitive dashboards**—so even non-technical users can derive actionable insights

## **Solution: Business Insights 360**
